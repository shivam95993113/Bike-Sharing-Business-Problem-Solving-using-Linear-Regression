# Bike-Sharing-Business-Problem-Solving-using-Linear-Regression
This project uses a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes in the U.S. This system is a service where bikes are made available for shared use for individuals who can borrow the bike from a “dock” which is usually computer-controlled wherein the users enter the payment information to unlock it.
